caption_1: <span class="bold uppercase white">the typical approach to taxes</span> is to go to your tax preparer at the end of every year praying that you don't owe more than you can pay. This is the most common strategy, and it is obviously reactive.
caption_2: <span class="bold uppercase white">we take a proactive approach</span> to tax planning. We will forecast what your current tax year looks like and illustrate what your tax liability will be while you still have time to <span class="bold">impact the outcome</span>. Knowing what the result will be will allow us to make decisions throughout the year that will reduce your tax liability. This will help make decisions in your financial plan, retirement planning, and ultimately help <span class="bold">achieve</span> your goals.
caption_3: There is a lot of confusion surrounding the changes that came with Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. We will show you exactly how that will impact you and how to optimize your taxes.
