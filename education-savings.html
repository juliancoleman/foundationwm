        You may have children, and you may worry about burdening them with
        student loan debt if they go to college. You may also have questions
        about the costs of college: what will it cost when my child goes to
        school? Can I help them in some way? Will my kid get financial aid? What
        if I save money for my child and they don't go to college? Can I afford
        to pay for it all?

        These are questions that most parents ask when it comes to plan for
        their children's education. You know you want to do something, but where
        to start?
