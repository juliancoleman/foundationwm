      was born and raised in the Central Valley. Tim grew up in Coalinga, CA
      where he attended Coalinga High School and went on to attend West Hills
      College Coalinga on a full scholarship. While living in Coalinga, Tim
      worked for his family’s business from the age of 16 (officially). Being
      involved in a successful family business, provided key lessons and
      principles that he still carries with him today. After graduating from
      West Hills, he attended Fresno State where he studied and achieved a B.S.
      Business Administration – Finance degree. In 2012 Tim began his journey in
      financial services while interning at Waddell and Reed. He would go on to
      become fully licensed (Series 7, 66, California Life and Health License)
      and become employed by the firm. Tim later joined Principal Financial
      Group. After working in the financial services industry for over 5 years,
      it was evident that it was time to create something different. He left and
      founded The Foundation Wealth Management, LLC based on principles
      practiced and learned throughout his entire career.
