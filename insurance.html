caption_1: Life Insurance, Disability Insurance, Long-Term Care Insurance, the list goes on! You probably see commercials offering coverage for as low as $10 dollars a month. What a deal! You may ask yourself questions like, do I need life insurance? What type of insurance should I get? I heard there is a type of policy to never buy? Can I afford it? How much do I need? All good questions.
