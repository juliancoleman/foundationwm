caption_1: If you are asking yourself questions about your legacy or what happens when I’m gone? Would my family be able to take care of themselves? Would they know how to handle my financial affairs once I’m gone? Estate planning is an often-forgotten step in the financial planning process. Having your financial affairs in order will allow your family peace in a time of grief.
caption_2: <span class="bold white uppercase">what we do:</span> we look at all your important legal documents (trusts, wills, advanced medical directives, etc.) to ensure they have accounted for your assets. We coordinate with your attorney (or we can refer you to professionals we work with) to make sure your team of professionals are on the same page. We want to learn exactly what type of memory and legacy you want to leave behind. We want to ensure your family has a trusted expert helping them handle the transition of your finances, so they can focus on what is important.
